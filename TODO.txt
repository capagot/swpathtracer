* Implement additional pixel samplers.

* Use indexes to avoid vertex data duplication.

* Care must be taken in the case of layered materials because of the IORs of each dielectric layer.
 For instance, for the top most layer, the ior_i is 1 (air), while for a dielectric in a inner
 layer, the ior_i will be the ior of the layer above.

* Implement AABB split for SBVH (for all primitives except Triangles).

* Implement the original Fresnel for dielectrics.

* BUG in the ray-sphere intersection.
